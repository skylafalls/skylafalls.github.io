as if oliver desperately begging for people to abandon me wasn't bad enough, they further completely disrespected me and refused to leave my shit alone. now they have another fg fanclub, hell yet another bbn foundation entirely.

the audacity to just spit in my face like that is just... unimaginable. it's another reason i despise this place so much, they never liked me, they've always hated me since the start. this is just disgusting. i don't know how to describe it.

..what am i supposed to say now? i don't want another bbn, another fanclub. i just want them to be left alone, they refuse to leave it alone, they bring it back from the dead. it's torturous. of course they won't stop.
