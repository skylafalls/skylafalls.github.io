so yeah i'm at that point where i'm back to being suicidal!!!!!

no but seriously despite me saying i was gonna "quit" babysitting fg, i am still trying to manage everything and make everything consistent, which has been a massive undertaking and i'm at a point where i feel like i should just die now

so many fucking dramas to deal with, so many numbers to scale, so many bugs to fix, it's getting to a point where even after hiring like 30+ people for the bbn foundation, i'm still being completely overwhelmed.

i'm so tired now, i'm tired of having to deal with bullshit, but at the same time i don't want the community to go back to 2023. this community is too good for that.

it feels like no matter how many friends i make, no matter how many mods i promote, no matter how many people i hire, i'm still lonely. i still have to do everything, i still have to watch over everything, i still have to be the middleman for dramas, i still have to be the one scaling and resolving all the dramas.
